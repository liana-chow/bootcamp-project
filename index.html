                <p>
                    My first programming project at City, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
                    City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding
                    of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a flower garden scene where
                    the amount of flowers, their starting height and final height are randomized. The
                    player would interact with it by "pushing" the ends of the stem to grow. Finally,
                    once all of the flowers have grown, an ending message is displayed.

                <p>
                    My first Java game, concluding the IN1007 Programming in Java module at City (2021). This Java game functionalities of the game include the pause, play and restart of a level; muting, unmuting, increasing or decreasing the sound of the background music; saving and loading the game from 3 different file locations; randomisation of each level; and the ability to switch between different characters who all have different traits. You can progress through 3 levels.
